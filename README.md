# appSisConv
Basic BackEnd for a small Dialogflow app:
 - Fulfillment for a Dialogflow ES agent (See related repo "appSisConvAgent"). Meant to work in Spanish.
 - 2 simple question-based games to choose from.
 - Questions picked from a MongoDB database (check "mongoString" in config file). Post functions and 2 JSON examples included, no special setup needed, just use the HTTP Post to create the new data from scratch.
